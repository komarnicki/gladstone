# What is Gladstone?
Gladstone is pure vanilla JavaScript application. **No additional frameworks, no jQuery, no heavy dependencies**.

With a very few steps, Gladstone gives you a phenomenal ability to put some custom markers across the globe and link them with dedicated stories. Read each of them, enjoy stunning pictures and finally jump from point to point to experience great adventure with some unique content.

## How Gladstone does it?

By telling this application where is the source of an input JSON (with some essential attributes and proper values), 
you will see stunningly customized Google Map with some clickable elements. Gladstone read coordinates and puts them 
precisely on a proper latitude and longitude.

## What's on my side?

All have to do, is to prepare a JSON. In most cases that will be a valid JSON string, generated by a server side language,
and then (probably) passed from the controller into the view layer. That's it! Follow Installation chapter to read detailed
instructions.

### Requirements

Absolutely minimal. **Modern** internet browser (not IE 6, not even 10) and internet connection (for Google Maps),

### Installation

1. Include the Gladstone style sheets `./css/gladstone.css` into your application.

2. Include Gladstone's library `./javascript/gladstone.js` to be able to create new Gladstone object.

3. Within `body` tag, create new container for the map `<div id="map_canvas"></div>`

4. Finally invoke Gladstone with some mandatory parameters


```
var gladstone,
    key = '',
    canvas = 'map_canvas'

gladstone = new Gladstone(key, canvas, markers, {
    'lang': 'pl',
    'storyAutoOpen': 1245
});

```
**Don't forget to generate your [API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/signup?hl=en).**

In terms of the `markers` variable, here is how it should look like

```
var markers = [
    {
        'id': 1, 
        'latitude': 39.623791, 
        'longitude': 19.921335, 
        'continent': 'europe', 
        'position': '-16° 55.101 S 145° 46.096 E',
        'zoom': 7, 
        'color': 'color_green1', 
        'image': './images/corfu.jpg', 
        'link': 'http://greece.local', 
        'date': '2012-09-27',
        'subTitle': 'Euismod lacus rutrum', 
        'label': 'Corfu', 
        'description': '<p>Lobortis leo est et lorem.</p>'
    }
];
```

Repeat this in a loop and your markers are ready to be set on the map.

#### JSON properties format

* **Integers**
  * id,
  * zoom,
* **Decimals**
  * latitude
  * longitude
* **Strings**
  * continent,
  * position,
  * color,
  * image,
  * link,
  * date,
  * subTitle,
  * label,
  * description (should be rich HTML but don't forget to strip unsafe tags, I preffer to leave `a`, `strong` as well as `p` and strip everything else)
  
#### Additional options

You can easily replace default options by defining them puting them explicitly into `options` variable while creating `new Gladstone` object:

* **lang** can be either `en` or `pl`. Everything that localization does it to translate some title attributes as well as some short messages and exceptions if thrown.
* **slugs** can be either `true` or `false`. If enabled, then it's up to you to replace the value of `links` in the JSON from full URLs to just slugs. Remove protocol and domain and relave the rest. This will enable dynamic URL change when jumping between stories.
* **urlRoot** is the main URL where all stories associated with your map are hosted. This works perfectly when `slugs` are enabled.
* **urlMap** is the main URL where Gladstone is located. Should be different than `urlRoot`.
* **storyAutoOpen** this one is my favourite and should be generated (if needed) by your server side language. If you want to open a particular story once the Gladstone is initialized, put here marker's ID, otherwise set to `0`. This works perfectly with elabled `slugs`. [Check this link](http://komarnicki.pl/mapa/wellington-picton) - it has a slug to existing story. PHP detects this slug and then sets `storyAutoOpen` with associated `id`. Thanks to that, story is automatically opened. Rocket science, isn't it? ;)

#### Predefined colors

To each marker assign one of below predefined class:

* color_red1
* color_red2
* color_yellow1
* color_yellow2
* color_green1
* color_green2
* color_blue1
* color_blue2
* color_blue3
* color_pink1
* color_violet1

Check `gladstone.css` to see how's everything defined.


### Live Demo

Curious? Check out how Gladstone works [on my own blog](http://komarnicki.pl/mapa).

### Current Status

Absolutely stable but still considered as an *alpha* version.

### License

Do what you want with Gladstone. Both home and commercial use allowed.
Only thing I ask is to leave header credits in `Gladstone.js` intact.
